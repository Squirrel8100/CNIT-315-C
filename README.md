# CNIT-315-C
Provided is a culmination of the Basic C code assignments and projects completed throughout my time taking CNIT 315.

I cannot vouch for the workability or full completion of the code projects. 
This is simply a stash of my progress within the course to be referenced personally in the future and to continue my learning. 

!!! If you are a current Purdue student taking 315 I would highly reccomend NOT making use of anything here. It absolutely will NOT help you as the course has changed, assignments are tweaked, and the cost of plagarism is your life and potential future degree. !!!

If there is an issue with this repository being public please notify me and i will unlist it.
